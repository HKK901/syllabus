      <h1>Chapter 7: Multimedia</h1>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Multimedia consist of two words ‘Multi’ and ‘Media’, Where multi means
          many and media means way/medium of expressing information. Hence,
          multimedia is the way of expressing information in different forms.
          The information can be expressed in either text, audio, video,
          graphics and animation. We use several forms of media for better
          understanding and effective communication. By using multimedia any
          information can be illustrated in greater depth.
        </p>

        <h2>Advantages of Multimedia</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>It helps to make communication much more effective</li>
          <li>
            It enhances the level of understanding in any particular topic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Games, Cartoons, movies are made more effective and realistic by
            using multimedia.
          </li>
          <li>
            It makes teaching and learning process much more interesting and
            intuitive.
          </li>
          <li>Virtual reality and simulation has become more realistic.</li>
        </ol>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Components/Elements of Multimedia</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Text: </b>It is the collection of alpha numeric values or any
            characters. It can be a word, single line or a paragraph. We can
            create and customize text by using several text editor or word
            processor such as MS-Word, Notepad etc. It is the basic form or way
            of expressing information. By using multimedia software we can
            customize the text by giving several size, color, type, style etc.
            Extension of text documents are .docx, .txt etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Graphics/Images: </b>”A picture is of thousand words" which means
            picture can describe things more than a text. Graphics generally
            refers to image or pictures. The smallest element of picture is
            called Pixel (Picture Element). Hence the quality of image or
            picture is denoted by number of pixel available in that picture,
            Generally termed as resolution. We use several multimedia software
            such as Adobe Photo shop, Corel draw, Adobe indesign etc. Extension
            of images are .jpeg, .png etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Audio:</b> Audio is the one of the important components of
            multimedia. It gives the sensation of hearing. Audio can be used to
            enhance the understanding level in any particular topic. Audio can
            be human voice, instrument notes, natural sound, digitally
            synthesized sound and many more. In these days Audio can be transfer
            from one place to another by converting it into digital signal. FM
            radio use this component to express their information. Several
            multimedia software such as windows media player can be used to play
            audio. Extension of audio are .mp3, .wma etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Video: </b>The video is the running frames of static pictures
            that means video are generated by capturing maximum number of images
            in unit time. Frame per second [FPS] is the term widely used to
            describe the smoothness of a video. Generally there are 15-25 frame
            per seconds, to generate smooth movement in video. But 30 and 60 FPS
            are the widely used standard in different devices. We can use
            different multimedia software such as iMovie, Final cut pro, Filmora
            etc to edit and customize our video. Extension of video are .mp4,
            .mpeg etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Animation:</b> Animation is the sequence of vector(Computer
            Generated) image displayed in rapid succession to provide visual
            effects. These image are computer based images. The animation is
            created to express ideas where complex explanation should be
            effectively deliver. These components are widely used in movie
            industry, and in other entertainment industry. Animation can be
            either 2D or 3D. 3D animation are more realistic in nature. So,
            different movies used 3D animation to express information which are
            not feasible in real life. We use several multimedia software such
            as Maya animation, Auto CAD, Macromedia flash etc. Extension of
            animation are .flv, .gif etc.
