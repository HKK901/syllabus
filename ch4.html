        <h1>Questions and Answers</h1><hr />
      <div class="section">
        <h2>1. What is Mail Merge in Microsoft Word?</h2>
        <p>
          Mail Merge is a feature in Microsoft Word that allows users to create
          personalized documents, such as letters or labels, by combining a
          template with data from a source, such as an Excel spreadsheet.
        </p>
        <p>The Mail Merge process consists of three main steps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Creating the Main Document:</strong> This is the template
            where you insert placeholders (called merge fields) for personalized
            data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Selecting the Data Source:</strong> This is usually an Excel
            file containing the information you want to merge into the document,
            like names, addresses, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inserting Merge Fields:</strong> You insert fields into the
            main document to pull information from the data source (e.g., name,
            address) and place it in the correct location.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once the document and data are prepared, Word can generate multiple
          personalized documents from the same template, saving time on tasks
          like sending form letters.

          environments for efficient data handling and document creation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>3. What is VLOOKUP in Microsoft Excel?</h2>
        <p>
          VLOOKUP (Vertical Lookup) is a function in Excel that allows users to
          search for a value in the first column of a table and return a
          corresponding value in the same row from another column. It's widely
          used for looking up data in large datasets.
        </p>
        <p>The VLOOKUP formula structure is:</p>
        <pre>
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])</pre
        >
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>lookup_value:</strong> The value you want to search for in
            the first column of the table.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>table_array:</strong> The range of cells that contains the
            data, including the column you want to look up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>col_index_num:</strong> The column number (starting from 1)
            from which the matching value will be returned.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>[range_lookup]:</strong> Optional. TRUE for an approximate
            match or FALSE for an exact match.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, if you have a list of employees with their IDs and
          salaries, you can use VLOOKUP to find an employee's salary based on
          their ID.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>4. What is Conditional Formatting in Microsoft Excel?</h2>
        <p>
          Conditional Formatting in Excel allows you to apply specific
          formatting (such as color, bold, or italics) to cells that meet
          certain conditions. This is useful for visually highlighting important
          information, such as high or low values, duplicate entries, or dates
          within a certain range.
        </p>
        <p>To apply conditional formatting:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Highlight the cells or range where you want to apply the formatting.
          </li>
          <li>Go to the Home tab and click Conditional Formatting.</li>
          <li>
            Choose a rule, such as Highlight Cell Rules or Top/Bottom Rules, or
            create a custom rule.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, you can highlight all cells with values greater than 1000
          in green or all negative numbers in red.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>5. What are Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel?</h2>
        <p>
          A Pivot Table is a powerful tool in Excel used to summarize, analyze,
          explore, and present large sets of data in a more meaningful way. It
          allows users to quickly create reports by grouping and summarizing
          data based on various criteria.
        </p>
        <p>To create a Pivot Table:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Select the data you want to analyze.</li>
          <li>Go to the Insert tab and click on Pivot Table.</li>
          <li>
            In the Pivot Table Field List, drag and drop fields into the Rows,
            Columns, Values, and Filters areas.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, you can create a Pivot Table to calculate the total sales
          per region or to count the number of products sold by category.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>6. What is the use of the COUNTIF function in Microsoft Excel?</h2>
        <p>
          The COUNTIF function in Excel counts the number of cells in a range
          that meet a specific condition. It's useful for quickly counting
          values that match certain criteria, such as how many times a
          particular word or number appears in a dataset.
        </p>
        <p>The COUNTIF formula structure is:</p>
        <pre>=COUNTIF(range, criteria)</pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>range:</strong> The range of cells you want to evaluate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>criteria:</strong> The condition that the cells must meet
            (e.g., a number, text, or expression).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, =COUNTIF(A1:A10, ">50") will count the number of cells in
          the range A1 to A10 that contain a value greater than 50.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>
          7. What is the use of the CONCATENATE function in Microsoft Excel?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The CONCATENATE function in Excel is used to join two or more text
          strings into a single string. It's useful when you want to combine
          first and last names or merge data from multiple cells into one.
        </p>
        <p>The CONCATENATE formula structure is:</p>
        <pre>=CONCATENATE(text1, text2, ...)</pre>
        <p>
          For example, if cell A1 contains "John" and cell B1 contains "Doe,"
          =CONCATENATE(A1, " ", B1) will result in "John Doe."
