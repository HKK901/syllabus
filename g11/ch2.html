      <h2>1's and 2's Complement</h2>
      <p>
        <b>1's Complement:</b> Reciprocal of 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s is its 1's
        complement. For eg, 1's Complement of (1011)2 is (0100)2 <br /><b>2's Complement:</b>
        Adding 1 to the 1's complement of a given binary number is its 2's
        complement. For eg, if (1010)2 is a given number then, its 1's
        complement is (0101)2 and 2's complement is (0101)2 +(1)2 = (0110)2

      <h2>Boolean Logic</h2>
      <p>
        Boolean Algebra is algebra of logic, which deals with the study of
        binary variables and logical operation. As every data are represented
        in terms binary values, we need to manipulate those values by using
        some certain rules and expression which we can do through Boolean
        algebra. It is most common and basic method to analysis and design
        logic circuit. It was introduced by an English mathematician George
        Boole. In Boolean algebra the variables can have only one of the two
        possible value 0 and1 (False or True). Every modern digital computers
        understand either this two values. <br /><br /><b>Boolean algebra:</b>
        It is algebra of logic which could accept either of the possible two
        values 0 and 1 and generate a result through logical relationship and
        operation.

        <br /><b>Boolean variable:</b> Those entities which has either or 0
        and 1 and denote some specific operation ore known as boolean
        variable. Simply, it is an entity in Boolean algebra which has only
        either of the two possible values. This variable are denoted by A, B,
        P, Q, X, Y, Z….

        <br /><b>Boolean function (logic functions):</b> Boolean function is
        an expression formed by binary variables, binary operators such as
        AND, OR, NOT, parentheses, and equal sign for a given set of value
        this boolean function gives the 0 or 1 as a result.

      <h2>1. What is Boolean Algebra?</h2>
      <p>
        Boolean Algebra is a branch of algebra that deals with binary
        variables and logic operations. It is used in digital logic design and
        computer science for circuit simplifications and logical expressions.
      </p>
      <p>It is based on three basic operations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AND (⋅):</strong> Outputs true if both inputs are true.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>OR (+):</strong> Outputs true if at least one input is true.
        </li>
        <li><strong>NOT (¬):</strong> Inverts the input value.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Boolean Algebra follows a set of rules and theorems to simplify
        logical expressions.
      </p>

      <h2>2. What are the basic laws of Boolean Algebra?</h2>
      <p>Boolean Algebra follows several fundamental laws:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Commutative Law:</strong> A + B = B + A and A ⋅ B = B ⋅ A
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Associative Law:</strong> (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) and (A ⋅
          B) ⋅ C = A ⋅ (B ⋅ C)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Distributive Law:</strong> A ⋅ (B + C) = (A ⋅ B) + (A ⋅ C)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Identity Law:</strong> A + 0 = A and A ⋅ 1 = A</li>
        <li><strong>Complement Law:</strong> A + A' = 1 and A ⋅ A' = 0</li>
        <li><strong>Idempotent Law:</strong> A + A = A and A ⋅ A = A</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These laws are used to simplify Boolean expressions for logic circuit
        design.
      </p>

      <h2>3. What are De Morgan’s Theorems?</h2>
      <p>
        De Morgan’s Theorems are important rules used to simplify Boolean
        expressions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First Theorem:</strong> ¬(A ⋅ B) = ¬A + ¬B</li>
        <li><strong>Second Theorem:</strong> ¬(A + B) = ¬A ⋅ ¬B</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These theorems help in converting AND operations to OR operations and
        vice versa, simplifying logic circuit implementation.

      <h2>4. Explain the use of Karnaugh Map (K-Map) in Boolean Algebra.</h2>
      <p>
        Karnaugh Map (K-Map) is a visual method used to simplify Boolean
        expressions. It organizes truth table values into a grid where
        adjacent cells differ by a single variable.
      </p>
      <p>Steps to simplify using K-Map:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Draw a K-Map based on the number of variables (2, 3, or 4
          variables).
        </li>
        <li>Fill in the K-Map with truth table values.</li>
        <li>Group adjacent 1s in powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).</li>
        <li>Write the simplified Boolean expression.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        K-Maps reduce complex expressions, making circuit design more
        efficient.

        5. What is a logic gate? Explain different types of logic gates.
      </h2>
      <p>
        A logic gate is an electronic circuit that performs Boolean
        operations. The basic types of logic gates include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AND Gate:</strong> Outputs 1 if both inputs are 1.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>OR Gate:</strong> Outputs 1 if at least one input is 1.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>NOT Gate:</strong> Inverts the input (1 becomes 0, and 0
          becomes 1).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>NAND Gate:</strong> Combination of AND and NOT (inverted AND
          output).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>NOR Gate:</strong> Combination of OR and NOT (inverted OR
          output).
        </li>
        <li><strong>XOR Gate:</strong> Outputs 1 if inputs are different.</li>
        <li><strong>XNOR Gate:</strong> Outputs 1 if inputs are the same.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Logic gates are used to build digital circuits in computing and
        electronics.
