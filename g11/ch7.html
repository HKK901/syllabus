    <h1>Chapter 7: Multimedia</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Multimedia consist of two words ‘Multi’ and ‘Media’, Where multi means
        many and media means way/medium of expressing information. Hence,
        multimedia is the way of expressing information in different forms.
        The information can be expressed in either text, audio, video,
        graphics and animation. We use several forms of media for better
        understanding and effective communication. By using multimedia any
        information can be illustrated in greater depth.

      <h2>Advantages of Multimedia</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>It helps to make communication much more effective</li>
        <li>
          It enhances the level of understanding in any particular topic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Games, Cartoons, movies are made more effective and realistic by
          using multimedia.
        </li>
        <li>
          It makes teaching and learning process much more interesting and
          intuitive.
        </li>
        <li>Virtual reality and simulation has become more realistic.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Components/Elements of Multimedia</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Text: </b>It is the collection of alpha numeric values or any
          characters. It can be a word, single line or a paragraph. We can
          create and customize text by using several text editor or word
          processor such as MS-Word, Notepad etc. It is the basic form or way
          of expressing information. By using multimedia software we can
          customize the text by giving several size, color, type, style etc.
          Extension of text documents are .docx, .txt etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Graphics/Images: </b>”A picture is of thousand words" which means
          picture can describe things more than a text. Graphics generally
          refers to image or pictures. The smallest element of picture is
          called Pixel (Picture Element). Hence the quality of image or
          picture is denoted by number of pixel available in that picture,
          Generally termed as resolution. We use several multimedia software
          such as Adobe Photo shop, Corel draw, Adobe indesign etc. Extension
          of images are .jpeg, .png etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Audio:</b> Audio is the one of the important components of
          multimedia. It gives the sensation of hearing. Audio can be used to
          enhance the understanding level in any particular topic. Audio can
          be human voice, instrument notes, natural sound, digitally
          synthesized sound and many more. In these days Audio can be transfer
          from one place to another by converting it into digital signal. FM
          radio use this component to express their information. Several
          multimedia software such as windows media player can be used to play
          audio. Extension of audio are .mp3, .wma etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Video: </b>The video is the running frames of static pictures
          that means video are generated by capturing maximum number of images
          in unit time. Frame per second [FPS] is the term widely used to
          describe the smoothness of a video. Generally there are 15-25 frame
          per seconds, to generate smooth movement in video. But 30 and 60 FPS
          are the widely used standard in different devices. We can use
          different multimedia software such as iMovie, Final cut pro, Filmora
          etc to edit and customize our video. Extension of video are .mp4,
          .mpeg etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Animation:</b> Animation is the sequence of vector(Computer
          Generated) image displayed in rapid succession to provide visual
          effects. These image are computer based images. The animation is
          created to express ideas where complex explanation should be
          effectively deliver. These components are widely used in movie
          industry, and in other entertainment industry. Animation can be
          either 2D or 3D. 3D animation are more realistic in nature. So,
          different movies used 3D animation to express information which are
          not feasible in real life. We use several multimedia software such
          as Maya animation, Auto CAD, Macromedia flash etc. Extension of
          animation are .flv, .gif etc.
