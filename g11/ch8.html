        <div class="section">
            <h2>Information Technology and its Social Impact</h2>
            <p>IT combines Information and Communication Technology to facilitate information flow globally. It impacts
                various fields like education, banking, healthcare, and industry. IT enables distant learning, quality
                control in production, and aids scientific research. However, it also brings challenges such as
                cybercrimes, data theft, and viruses, disrupting social peace and security.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Information Security:</h3>
            <p>IT security involves protecting networks from unauthorized access or malicious activities. It is
                essential for safeguarding data. Security objectives include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Confidentiality:</b> Information is accessible only to authorized users.</li>
                <li><b>Integrity:</b> Ensures data accuracy and prevents unauthorized tampering.</li>
                <li><b>Availability:</b> Ensures information is accessible when required.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cryptography:</h3>
            <p>Cryptography secures communication by converting readable data into unreadable format (encryption), which
                can only be returned to readable form (decryption) by authorized users.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encryption: Converting readable data into an unreadable format.</li>
                <li>Decryption: Returning unreadable data to a readable format by authorized users.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Digital Divide:</h2>
