        Computer is an electronic device device derived from the Latin word
        "computere" which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures
        as an input which are isolated and uninterpreted through input device,
        process it according to the requirement of the user or command supplied
        by the user, store it before and after processing of require and produce
        a meaningful information as an output through an output device.
        Generally, computer works on IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle. It
        follows GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) algorithm which means the output
        is always based on the input supplied by the user. The basic operation
        of computer is illustrated by following block diagram.
