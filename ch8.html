            <h2>Information Technology and its Social Impact</h2>
            <p>IT combines Information and Communication Technology to facilitate information flow globally. It impacts various fields like education, banking, healthcare, and industry.

            <h3>Information Security:</h3>
            <p>IT security involves protecting networks from unauthorized access or malicious activities. It is essential for safeguarding data. Security objectives include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Confidentiality:</b> Information is accessible only to authorized users.</li>
                <li><b>Integrity:</b> Ensures data accuracy and prevents unauthorized tampering.</li>
                <li><b>Availability:</b> Ensures information is accessible when required.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cryptography:</h3>
            <p>Cryptography secures communication by converting readable data into unreadable format (encryption), which can only be returned to readable form (decryption) by authorized users.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encryption: Converting readable data into an unreadable format.</li>
                <li>Decryption: Returning unreadable data to a readable format by authorized users.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
