        <h1>Information Security and Cyber Law</h1><hr>
        <p>
            <h2>1. Information Technology and its Social Impact</h2>
            IT combines Information and Communication Technology to facilitate information flow globally. It impacts various fields like education, banking, healthcare, and industry. IT enables distant learning, quality control in production, and aids scientific research. However, it also brings challenges such as cybercrimes, data theft, and viruses, disrupting social peace and security.

            <h3>Information Security:</h3>
            IT security involves protecting networks from unauthorized access or malicious activities. It is essential for safeguarding data. Security objectives include: 
            <ul>
                <li><b>Confidentiality:</b> Information is accessible only to authorized users.</li>
                <li><b>Integrity:</b> Ensures data accuracy and prevents unauthorized tampering.</li>
                <li><b>Availability:</b> Ensures information is accessible when required.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Cryptography:</h3>
            Cryptography secures communication by converting readable data into unreadable format (encryption), which can only be returned to readable form (decryption) by authorized users. 
            <ul>
                <li>Encryption: Converting readable data into an unreadable format.</li>
                <li>Decryption: Returning unreadable data to a readable format by authorized users.</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>2. Digital Divide:</h2>
            The Digital Divide refers to the gap between those with access to and knowledge of technology (computer-literate) and those without. This divide exists across urban vs. rural areas, education levels, and socioeconomic status. It has become a global issue with efforts to bridge this gap. <br>

            <h2>3. Computer or Cyber Ethics:</h2>
            Cyber ethics involves a set of moral guidelines for computer professionals to prevent criminal activities. Some principles include: 
            <ol>
                <li>Do not steal or misuse others' data.</li>
                <li>Avoid spreading viruses or altering data.</li>
                <li>Do not use unauthorized software or access.</li>
                <li>Respect others' intellectual property and privacy.</li>
            </ol>


            <h2>4. Cyber Crime:</h2>
            Cybercrime refers to illegal activities involving computers or the internet. Examples include:
            <ol>
                <li>Stealing information or software piracy.</li>
                <li>Spreading viruses, hacking, or password guessing.</li>
                <li>Misusing electronic transactions.</li>
                <li>Cyberbullying or rude online comments.</li>
            </ol>

            
            <h2>5. Cyber Law:</h2>
            Cyber Law governs the use of computers and the internet. It provides legal consequences for cybercrimes. In Nepal, the Electronic Transaction Ordinance, 2005 addresses crimes and enforces regulations related to:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Digital signatures and intellectual property rights.</b></li>
                <li><b>Telecommunication, data protection, and privacy.</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. IT Policy of Nepal:</h2>
            The IT Policy of Nepal aims to:
            <ol>
                <li>Prioritize IT as a government sector.</li>
                <li>Promote knowledge-based industries and employment.</li>
                <li>Enhance public services through e-government.</li>
                <li>Increase international IT collaboration.</li>
                <li>Improve IT infrastructure, including the Government Integrated Data Center (GIDC).</li>
                <li>This condensed version captures the key concepts while maintaining the essential details.</li>
            </ol>
