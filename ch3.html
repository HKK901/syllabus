        <h2>Operating System</h2>
        <p>
          An operating system (OS) is an integrated set of program that controls
          overall resources such as CPU, memory, input-output device of the
          computer system. The major objective of operating system is to improve
          the performance and efficiency of a computer system. Like the manager
          of a company, an operating system is responsible for the smooth and
          efficient functioning of the entire computer system. The operating
          system provides the platform for other application program/software to
          run and execute. It provides user with an interface so that user can
          easily communicate with computers, which is more convenient to use and
          operate.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Operating System</h2>
        <h3>A) Types of Operating Systems Based on Processing:</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Multi-programming OS:</b> Executes multiple user programs on a
          single processor, improving resource utilization. Examples include
          multi-tasking, multi-processing, and multi-user systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Multi-tasking OS:</b> Allows multiple tasks to run concurrently in
          a single-user environment. Common examples are MS-Windows, Linux, and
          macOS.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Multiprocessing OS:</b> Uses more than one processor to run
          programs simultaneously, improving execution speed. UNIX is a typical
          example.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Time-Sharing OS:</b> Allows multiple users to share CPU time. Tasks
          switch frequently, providing an immediate response. Examples: MS-DOS,
          UNIX.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Batch Processing OS:</b> Groups similar jobs into batches for
          sequential processing without user interaction during execution.
          Common in payroll, weather forecasting, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Multi-threading OS:</b> Divides a program into threads that can be
          executed concurrently, improving efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Real-time OS:</b> Processes tasks in a predefined time, suitable
          for critical operations like flight seat availability and rocket
          launching systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Online Processing OS:</b> Processes transactions immediately as
          they occur, allowing user interaction during processing.
        </p>
        <h3>B) Types of Operating Systems Based on User Interface (UI):</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Character User Interface (CUI):</b> Operates using text-based
          commands. It is less user-friendly, requiring users to memorize
          commands. Examples include MS-DOS and UNIX.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</b> Allows interaction using
          graphics, icons, and dialogue boxes. It’s more user-friendly and
          easier for non-technical users.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>3. What is Memory Management in an Operating System?</h2>
        <p>
          Memory Management is a function of the OS that manages the computer's
          memory resources. It allocates memory to processes, keeps track of
          memory usage, and ensures that one process does not interfere with the
          memory of another process.
        </p>
        <p>The main memory management techniques include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Contiguous Memory Allocation:</strong> Assigns a single
            contiguous block of memory to a process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paging:</strong> Divides memory into fixed-size pages and
            divides processes into pages for non-contiguous allocation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Segmentation:</strong> Divides memory into variable-sized
            segments, such as code, data, and stack segments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Virtual Memory:</strong> Uses a portion of the hard drive as
            if it were additional RAM, allowing the system to handle larger
            programs.

        <p>
          A process is a program in execution. It is an active entity that
          contains the program code and its current activity. A process has
          several components:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Program Counter (PC):</strong> Keeps track of the address of
            the next instruction to be executed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Process Stack:</strong> Stores temporary data such as
            function parameters, return addresses, and local variables.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Section:</strong> Stores global variables used by the
            process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Heap:</strong> Used for dynamic memory allocation during the
            execution of the program.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Processes can be in various states, including New, Ready, Running,
          Waiting, and Terminated.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>5. What is File Management in an Operating System?</h2>
        <p>
          File Management is the part of the operating system responsible for
          organizing, storing, and retrieving files. It provides an interface
          for users and programs to interact with files on storage devices.
        </p>
        <p>The key components of file management include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>File System:</strong> A method for organizing files on
            storage devices, such as FAT, NTFS, or ext4.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File Operations:</strong> Includes creating, reading,
            writing, deleting, and renaming files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File Access Methods:</strong> Defines how data is accessed
            in files, such as sequential or direct access.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Directories:</strong> Structures used to organize files into
            hierarchical folders or directories.
          </li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>6. What is a Deadlock in an Operating System?</h2>
        <p>
          A deadlock is a situation in an operating system where two or more
          processes are unable to proceed because they are each waiting for the
          other to release a resource. Deadlock can lead to a system halt or
          indefinite waiting.
        </p>
        <p>The four conditions for a deadlock are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Mutual Exclusion:</strong> Resources cannot be shared
            between processes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hold and Wait:</strong> Processes holding resources are
            waiting for additional resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Preemption:</strong> Resources cannot be forcibly taken
            away from processes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Circular Wait:</strong> A circular chain of processes exists
            where each process is waiting for a resource held by the next
            process in the chain.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Deadlock prevention, avoidance, and detection techniques are used to
          handle deadlock situations.
