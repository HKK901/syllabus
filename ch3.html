        <h1>Computer software and operating system</h1><hr>
        <p>Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks</p>

        <p><h2>Operating System</h2>
            An operating system (OS) is an integrated set of program that controls overall resources such as CPU, memory, input-output device of the computer system. The major objective of operating system is to improve the performance and efficiency of a computer system. Like the manager of a company, an operating system is responsible for the smooth and efficient functioning of the entire computer system. The operating system provides the platform for other application program/software to run and execute. It provides user with an interface so that user can easily communicate with computers, which is more convenient to use and operate. <br>
            <h3>Functions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>It controls, monitor and co-ordinate overall operation of our computer system.</li>
                <li>It act as an interface between user and computer.</li>
                <li>It provide platform to develop, run and execute other computer program.</li>
                <li>It manages hardware resources such as CPU,  memories, input-output terminals, networking equipment etc.</li>
                <li>It hides programming and hardware complexity to the user.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Types of Operating System</h2>
            <h3>A) Types of Operating Systems Based on Processing:</h3>
            <b>Multi-programming OS:</b> Executes multiple user programs on a single processor, improving resource utilization. Examples include multi-tasking, multi-processing, and multi-user systems. <br>
            <b>Multi-tasking OS:</b> Allows multiple tasks to run concurrently in a single-user environment. Common examples are MS-Windows, Linux, and macOS. <br>
            <b>Multiprocessing OS:</b> Uses more than one processor to run programs simultaneously, improving execution speed. UNIX is a typical example. <br>
            <b>Time-Sharing OS:</b> Allows multiple users to share CPU time. Tasks switch frequently, providing an immediate response. Examples: MS-DOS, UNIX. <br>
            Advantages: Quick responses, reduced CPU idle time. <br>
            Disadvantages: Reliability, security, and integrity issues. <br>
            <b>Batch Processing OS:</b> Groups similar jobs into batches for sequential processing without user interaction during execution. Common in payroll, weather forecasting, etc. <br>
            <b>Multi-threading OS:</b> Divides a program into threads that can be executed concurrently, improving efficiency. <br>
            <b>Real-time OS:</b> Processes tasks in a predefined time, suitable for critical operations like flight seat availability and rocket launching systems. <br>
            <b>Online Processing OS:</b> Processes transactions immediately as they occur, allowing user interaction during processing.

            <h3>B) Types of Operating Systems Based on User Interface (UI):</h3>
            <b>Character User Interface (CUI):</b> Operates using text-based commands. It is less user-friendly, requiring users to memorize commands. Examples include MS-DOS and UNIX. <br>
            Features: Single-user, single-tasking, faster than GUI, and no graphical support. <br>
            Advantages: Quick responses for users who know the commands. <br>
            Disadvantages: Difficult for beginners; not visually appealing. <br>
            <b>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</b> Allows interaction using graphics, icons, and dialogue boxes. Itâ€™s more user-friendly and easier for non-technical users. <br>
            Features: Multi-tasking, user-friendly, supports multimedia, and requires more memory. <br>
            Advantages: Easy to use, supports full multimedia. <br>
            Disadvantages: Consumes more memory and resources. <br>
