        <h2>Computer Program</h2>
        <p>
          In computing, a program is a specific set of ordered operations for a
          computer to perform. In the modern computer that John von Neumann
          outlined in 1945, the program contains a one-at-a-time sequence of
          instructions that the computer follows. Typically, the program is put
          into a storage area accessible to the computer.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Programming Language</h2>
        <p>
          A programming language is a set of instructions used to communicate
          with a computer to perform tasks. It consists of keywords, variables,
          operators, loops, and other elements, using numbers, special symbols,
          and alphanumeric values. The process of writing code is known as
          programming, and the person who writes programs is called a
          programmer.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Types of Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Low-Level Language:</b> Machine-dependent and harder to use,
          requiring detailed system knowledge. <br />
          <b>Machine Level Language (1GL):</b> Uses binary (0's and 1's)
          understood by the processor, offering high execution speed but
          difficult to write and debug. <br />
          <b>Assembly Language (2GL):</b> Uses mnemonics (e.g., ADD, SUB)
          instead of binary but still requires knowledge of system architecture.
          It’s faster than high-level languages but more complex to write and
          debug. <br />
          <b>High-Level Language (HLL):</b> Closer to human languages (like
          English), machine-independent, and easier to write and debug. Requires
          a compiler or interpreter to convert to machine code. <br />
          Examples: C, C++, Python, JavaScript. <br />
          Advantages: Easier to write, debug, and understand. <br />
          Machine-independent. Faster development. <br />
          Disadvantages: Slower execution than low-level languages.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Classifications of High-Level Languages</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Procedural Oriented Language (3GL):</b> Focuses on procedure and
          logic. Examples: C, FORTRAN, QBasic. It’s easier to debug but slower
          in execution and offers less data security. <br />
          <b>Object-Oriented Language (4GL):</b> Focuses on data rather than
          procedure, with features like encapsulation, inheritance, and
          security. Examples: C#, Java, C++. It’s more user-friendly but slower
          than 3GL. <br />
          <b>Natural Language (5GL):</b> Uses normal communication language,
          still in development. Example: PROLOG. Easier to debug, but execution
          is slow and difficult for hardware-specific tasks. <br />
          <b>Language Translator/Processor:</b> Converts programs from
          high-level or assembly language into machine-readable code. <br />
          <b>Assembler:</b> Converts assembly language into machine code. <br />
          <b>Compiler:</b> Translates an entire high-level program into machine
          code at once (e.g., C, C++). <br />
          <b>Interpreter:</b> Translates a high-level program one statement at a
          time, making debugging easier but slower in execution (e.g., BASIC,
          PHP).

        <h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>1. What is Programming?</h2>
        <p>
          Programming is the process of writing instructions (code) that a
          computer can execute to perform specific tasks. It involves
          problem-solving, logic, and algorithm development to create software
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>Programming is done using different languages such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Python:</strong> Easy to learn and widely used for data
            science, web development, and automation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>C++:</strong> Used for system programming, game development,
            and competitive coding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Java:</strong> Used for mobile applications (Android),
            enterprise applications, and backend development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>JavaScript:</strong> Primarily used for web development and
            interactive websites.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Programming requires logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and an
          understanding of syntax and semantics.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>2. What is an Algorithm?</h2>
        <p>
          An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a
          problem in a finite number of steps. It is used in programming to
          define logic before writing actual code.
        </p>
        <p>Characteristics of a good algorithm:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Definiteness:</strong> Each step must be clear and
            unambiguous.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finiteness:</strong> It must have a finite number of steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Each step should be simple and
            executable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Input & Output:</strong> It should take input and produce an
            output.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example Algorithm: Finding the sum of two numbers</p>
        <pre>
          Step 1: Start
          Step 2: Input two numbers (A, B)
          Step 3: Sum = A + B
          Step 4: Display Sum
          Step 5: Stop
            </pre

      <div class="section">
        <h2>3. What is a Flowchart?</h2>
        <p>
          A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm using
          symbols to illustrate steps and decision-making in a program.
        </p>
        <p>Common flowchart symbols:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Oval:</strong> Start/End</li>
          <li><strong>Parallelogram:</strong> Input/Output</li>
          <li><strong>Rectangle:</strong> Process (Calculation or Action)</li>
          <li><strong>Diamond:</strong> Decision (Yes/No or True/False)</li>
          <li><strong>Arrow:</strong> Flow of execution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Flowcharts help programmers visualize logic before coding, making
          debugging easier.

        <h2>4. What are Variables and Data Types?</h2>
        <p>
          A variable is a named storage location in memory used to hold data.
          The value of a variable can change during program execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data types define the type of data that a variable can hold. Common
          data types include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Integer (int):</strong> Holds whole numbers (e.g., 5, -10).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Float (float/double):</strong> Holds decimal numbers (e.g.,
            3.14, -2.5).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Character (char):</strong> Holds a single character (e.g.,
            'A', '5').
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>String:</strong> Holds a sequence of characters (e.g.,
            "Hello").
          </li>
          <li><strong>Boolean (bool):</strong> Holds True or False values.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example in Python:</p>
        <pre>
          # User information
          username = "JohnDoe"    # String
          score = 4500            # Integer
          completion_rate = 87.5  # Float
          is_admin = False        # Boolean          
        </pre>
