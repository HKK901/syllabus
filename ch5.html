        <h1>Programming Concepts and Logic</h1><hr>
        <p>In computing, a program is a specific set of ordered operations for a computer to perform. In the modern computer that John von Neumann outlined in 1945, the program contains a one-at-a-time sequence of instructions that the computer follows. Typically, the program is put into a storage area accessible to the computer.
            <h2>Programming Language</h2>
            A programming language is a set of instructions used to communicate with a computer to perform tasks. It consists of keywords, variables, operators, loops, and other elements, using numbers, special symbols, and alphanumeric values. The process of writing code is known as programming, and the person who writes programs is called a programmer. 
            <h2>Types of Programming Languages</h2>
            <b>Low-Level Language:</b> Machine-dependent and harder to use, requiring detailed system knowledge. <br>
           <b>Machine Level Language (1GL):</b> Uses binary (0's and 1's) understood by the processor, offering high execution speed but difficult to write and debug. <br>
            <b>Assembly Language (2GL):</b> Uses mnemonics (e.g., ADD, SUB) instead of binary but still requires knowledge of system architecture. It’s faster than high-level languages but more complex to write and debug. <br>
            <b>High-Level Language (HLL):</b> Closer to human languages (like English), machine-independent, and easier to write and debug. Requires a compiler or interpreter to convert to machine code. <br>
            Examples: C, C++, Python, JavaScript. <br>
            Advantages: Easier to write, debug, and understand. <br>
            Machine-independent. Faster development. <br>
            Disadvantages: Slower execution than low-level languages. <br>

            <h2>Classifications of High-Level Languages:</h2>
            <b>Procedural Oriented Language (3GL):</b> Focuses on procedure and logic. Examples: C, FORTRAN, QBasic. It’s easier to debug but slower in execution and offers less data security. <br>
            <b>Object-Oriented Language (4GL):</b> Focuses on data rather than procedure, with features like encapsulation, inheritance, and security. Examples: C#, Java, C++. It’s more user-friendly but slower than 3GL. <br>
            <b>Natural Language (5GL):</b> Uses normal communication language, still in development. Example: PROLOG. Easier to debug, but execution is slow and difficult for hardware-specific tasks. <br>
            <b>Language Translator/Processor:</b> Converts programs from high-level or assembly language into machine-readable code. <br>
            <b>Assembler:</b> Converts assembly language into machine code.
            Compiler: Translates an entire high-level program into machine code at once (e.g., C, C++). <br>
            <b>Interpreter:</b> Translates a high-level program one statement at a time, making debugging easier but slower in execution (e.g., BASIC, PHP). <br>

    <h1>Questions and Answers</h1> <hr>

    <h2>1. What is Programming?</h2>
    <p>Programming is the process of writing instructions (code) that a computer can execute to perform specific tasks.
      It involves problem-solving, logic, and algorithm development to create software applications.</p>
    <p>Programming is done using different languages such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Python:</strong> Easy to learn and widely used for data science, web development, and automation.</li>
      <li><strong>C++:</strong> Used for system programming, game development, and competitive coding.</li>
      <li><strong>Java:</strong> Used for mobile applications (Android), enterprise applications, and backend
        development.</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Primarily used for web development and interactive websites.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Programming requires logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and an understanding of syntax and semantics.</p>

    <h2>2. What is an Algorithm?</h2>
    <p>An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a problem in a finite number of steps. It is
      used in programming to define logic before writing actual code.</p>
    <p>Characteristics of a good algorithm:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definiteness:</strong> Each step must be clear and unambiguous.</li>
      <li><strong>Finiteness:</strong> It must have a finite number of steps.</li>
      <li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Each step should be simple and executable.</li>
      <li><strong>Input & Output:</strong> It should take input and produce an output.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example Algorithm: Finding the sum of two numbers</p>
    <pre>
        Step 1: Start
        Step 2: Input two numbers (A, B)
        Step 3: Compute Sum = A + B
        Step 4: Display Sum
        Step 5: Stop
    </pre>

    <h2>3. What is a Flowchart?</h2>
    <p>A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm using symbols to illustrate steps and decision-making
      in a program.</p>
    <p>Common flowchart symbols:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Oval:</strong> Start/End</li>
      <li><strong>Parallelogram:</strong> Input/Output</li>
      <li><strong>Rectangle:</strong> Process (Calculation or Action)</li>
      <li><strong>Diamond:</strong> Decision (Yes/No or True/False)</li>
      <li><strong>Arrow:</strong> Flow of execution</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Flowcharts help programmers visualize logic before coding, making debugging easier.</p>

    <h2>4. What are Variables and Data Types?</h2>
    <p>A variable is a named storage location in memory used to hold data. The value of a variable can change during
      program execution.</p>
    <p>Data types define the type of data that a variable can hold. Common data types include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Integer (int):</strong> Holds whole numbers (e.g., 5, -10).</li>
      <li><strong>Float (float/double):</strong> Holds decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5).</li>
      <li><strong>Character (char):</strong> Holds a single character (e.g., 'A', '5').</li>
      <li><strong>String:</strong> Holds a sequence of characters (e.g., "Hello").</li>
      <li><strong>Boolean (bool):</strong> Holds True or False values.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example in Python:</p>
    <pre>
        age = 20           # Integer
        price = 10.99      # Float
        name = "Alice"     # String
        is_student = True  # Boolean
    </pre>

    <h2>5. What are Conditional Statements?</h2>
    <p>Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions based on conditions. The main types are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>If Statement:</strong> Executes a block of code if the condition is true.</li>
      <li><strong>If-Else Statement:</strong> Executes one block if the condition is true, otherwise executes another
        block.</li>
      <li><strong>Nested If:</strong> If statements inside other if statements.</li>
      <li><strong>Switch Case (in some languages):</strong> Used as an alternative to multiple if-else statements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example in Python:</p>
    <pre>
        age = 18
        if age >= 18:
            print("You are eligible to vote.")
        else:
            print("You are not eligible to vote.")
    </pre>

    <h2>6. What are Loops in Programming?</h2>
    <p>Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. The main types of loops are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>For Loop:</strong> Repeats a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
      <li><strong>While Loop:</strong> Repeats while a condition is true.</li>
      <li><strong>Do-While Loop (in some languages):</strong> Executes at least once before checking the condition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example in Python (For Loop):</p>
    <pre>
        for i in range(1, 6):
            print(i)
    </pre>
    <p>This prints numbers from 1 to 5.</p>

    <h2>7. What are Functions in Programming?</h2>
    <p>A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help in modular programming and
      avoid repetition.</p>
    <p>Types of Functions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Built-in Functions:</strong> Predefined functions like print(), len(), etc.</li>
      <li><strong>User-defined Functions:</strong> Functions created by the programmer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example in Python:</p>
    <pre>
        def greet(name):
            print("Hello, " + name + "!")

        greet("Alice")
    </pre>

    <h2>8. What is an Array?</h2>
    <p>An array is a data structure that stores multiple values of the same data type in a single variable.</p>
    <p>Example of an array in Python (using a list):</p>
    <pre>
        numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
        print(numbers[0])  # Output: 10
    </pre>
    <p>Arrays allow efficient storage and manipulation of data.</p>

    <h2>9. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?</h2>

      <li><strong>Object:</strong> An instance of a class.</li>
      <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Hiding data within an object.</li>
      <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Reusing code by inheriting properties from another class.</li>
      <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> One function behaving differently based on the context.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. What is C Programming?</h2>
